    <h3>Petals of Reincarnation</h3>
    <p><i>Petals of Reincarnation</i> is an odd manga for me to recommend because I’m not entirely sure what part about it I like and there are some pretty wild warnings I need to get out of the way. The characters in this story all claim the power of a “Great” through their magic system (and some even become them) and it’s very interesting and very clearly well researched. All of the powers are interesting and tailored to a specific aspect of that real person's legacy.</p>
    <p>The problem begins when “Greats” can be heroes or villains of history, meaning that some pretty wild characters show up with some pretty insane powers, the easiest example being Hitler and his power of panoptic vision using anything that has a swastika on it. Kinda baller, but also wildly gray area.</p>
    <p>The characters are memorable and distinct while the cast grows exponentially, as do the threats the core group comes in contact with, and the threat of death is very real. Characters die and stay dead and that is awesome and twists feel real and earned by the story when friends become villains or villains become friends. A very fun ride that is close to conclusion.</p>

    <h3>Make the Exorcist Fall in Love ☆</h3>
    <p>This manga caught my eye initially purely based off of its unique artstyle. The lines are thicker, but the shapes and characters are softer. The series, however, is sparse in terms of softness, and while its characters do have moments of peace, the story is anything but peaceful.</p>
    <p><i>Make the Exorcist Fall in Love</i> follows the young Priest whose name is literally always just boy or Priest and his protection of Imuri, a demon girl sent by Satan whom he thinks is an innocent bystander caught up in a war of attrition between Satan and his Sins and the humans and their Priests. </p>
    <p>And while these threats are very real, they are often overshadowed by the depth of the relationships between the characters on different sides of this eternal battle. All of the characters are electrifying, especially Imuri and Verg, and their decisions never fail to enthral me. I hope this story is far from over.</p>

    <h3>Yumekui Merry ✔ ☆</h3>
    <p><i>Yumekui Merry</i> is my all-timer. It is the first manga I read because of an anime and it was, unbeknownst to me, still ongoing, allowing my first manga to also be a hell of a ride as I watched it go from scan group to scan group, struggling to finish, catching up to the raws only single digit chapters away from the finale.</p>
    <p>I love this manga with my whole heart, and with only a jaunty 141 chapters, it breezes right by. It has one of my favorite MC's, commits wholeheartedly to its premise, and sticks the very difficult landing it set up for.</p>
    <p>To give a little more of what is actually going on in the story, it starts with our main man Yumeji, a student with friends and hobbies, joining together with Merry, a person not from around these parts, hellbent on send Dream Demons back to the Dream World. They monster-of-the-week their way into an overarching story with many twists and turns and ends with them essentially fighting god. It's awesome.</p>

    <img src="https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/large/bx86639-ox749qrCTq7K.jpg" alt="After the Rain manga cover" style="float:right; height:350px; padding-left: 15px">
    <h3>After the Rain ✔</h3>
    <p>This manga had me on the edge of my seat right to the end, which is odd, because most of its chapters are structured more as checkpoints than real dramatic or nailbiter moments. The slow and steady pace at which the romance marched felt unstoppable, which was booth enthralling and terrifying.</p>
    <p>This was a 45 year old manager who is just trying to collect his paycheck getting asked out and pursued by a 17 year old girl who is a high school junior. Bad bad bad bad wrong bad no! </p>
    <p>These two characters are slowly defined through repetition and go through tremendous growth, especially our main girl, and throughout the story it always feels teetering close to an uncrossable line. However, the story does end in a hopeful manner and in a way I think many people would be happy with. It’s not bittersweet, it isn’t wrong, it’s certainly not bad, but perfectly.</p>

    <h3>You and I are Polar Opposites ✔</h3>
    <p>This manga is quick as heck so you better read it. Coming in at only 65 chapters, this manga did the unthinkable: ended high. While I would have loved a dozen or so more chapters to wrap up some of the looser ends, the trajectories and momentum of the finale chapters send off the manga in the best possible way. </p>
    <p>While at first, this early ending did annoy me slightly, in retrospect, it was a wise choice. This romance between not just the main two but their many friends and friends they make along the way build out a friend group of misfits that is as colorful and believable as the ones you often find in high school.</p>
    <p>The characters are exaggerated in the best ways, leaning more towards endearing than cringey, and are written in a very “this is so me” way that has you relating to many little parts of many characters. It’s great stuff. It’s short. Why are you still here? Go read it!</p>

    <h3>Yancha Gal no Anjou-san ☆</h3>
    <p>When I started reading manga initially, I basically only read romance for a bit, and a lot of them were just okay, or I dropped, or both. This manga, however, despite starting out similar to many that I dropped, only got better and better with time and I can confiidently say is one of the better ensemble-long-running-romance manga. </p>
    <p>Despite not being completed, the story feels like it could both go on for many more chapters without going stale or end in a dozen chapters with a heartfelt conclusion I'd be happy with. It strikes a perfect balance of progression and evolution while staying true to its original, slice-of-life charm.</p>
    <p>Do be warned, though, there's a bit of ecchi in there, nothing too crazy, but it's there. Even with this "downside," though, this series is great as it follows along the highs and lows of a cute high school romance. Just overall very sweet.</p>

    <img src="https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/large/bx169922-kd2WNbRBJqWA.jpg" alt="Hope You're Happy, Lemon manga cover" style="float:right; height:350px; padding-left: 15px">
    <h3>Hope You're Happy, Lemon ☆</h3>
    <p><i>Hope You’re Happy, Lemon</i> is a body swap story that feels like it was actually thought about before writing. The swaps happen right from the get go, not between two crushes but of ex’s who haven't spoken in years. The swaps happen every other day so they are forced to become closer, but at arms length, and this setup also gives way to strategy as they essentially have to “share” their bodies.</p>
    <p>All of the characters are college aged and speak honestly so often that it is a breath of fresh air. You know when you read a manga and you can’t stand it because all of the drama of the past 30 chapters could have been solved by like, one conversation? This manga is whatever the opposite of that is. Misunderstandings still happen but characters just like, talk, and things get figured out. It’s so nice.</p>
    <p>All of the characters that are part of this slowly created love dodecahedron are easy to root for and have multiple potential places that I would be happy if they ended up. So thoughtfully crafted, and such fun dialogue, and I didn’t even get a chance to mention the art! It’s simply fantastic. Thank you so much skitters for showing me this.</p>

    <img src="https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/large/bx163033-s9HsY7MJzuPX.jpg" alt="Seven Sleeping Beauties manga cover" style="float:right; height:350px; padding-left: 15px">
    <h3>Seven Sleeping Beauties ☆</h3>
    <p>So like, I’ll be honest. I thought this was gonna be a pretty trashy harem manga with decent art. This was like half right. It is still more ecchi than it needs to be, and it is still a harem, but the largest improvement is an actual MC and an actual plot.</p>
    <p>Sir Alec, our MC, is the most genuine, thoughtful, real person in a harem I have read in a long time, maybe ever. He has thoughts, is respectful of women, has flaws and makes mistakes, but grows and learns. His chemistry is believable with all of the girls, his interactions are always cute, and he’s only a little dense.</p>
    <p>The plot is also very interesting. There’s both political drama from Alec’s home country wanting to invade and also the question of the curse that put a whole kingdom to sleep. It’s awesome! Why aren't there more harems like this?</p>
    <p>Oh yeah, and the girls are hot or whatever. (My favorites are Chiara and Flora.)</p>
