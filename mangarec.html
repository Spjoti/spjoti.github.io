    <h3>How to Navigate my Personal Recommendations</h3>
    <p>So my recommendations are split into genres and ordered from top to bottom as “most recommended” to “least recommended”. This does not mean the last thing on the list is bad, it just means I like other things more. All of the things I am recommending I have rated very highly or I think highly of if they are not complete.</p>
    <p>Anything finished will be marked as complete with a (✔) and a full list of tags (courtesy of Anilist) will be in each one's description/review. If it is something I super duper highly recomend, it will have a (☆). I hope you enjoy!</p>

    <h3>Yumekui Merry ✔ ☆</h3>
    <p><i>Yumekui Merry</i> is my all-timer. It is the first manga I read because of an anime and it was, unbeknownst to me, still ongoing, allowing my first manga to also be a hell of a ride as I watched it go from scan group to scan group, struggling to finish, catching up to the raws only single digit chapters away from the finale.</p>
    <p>I love this manga with my whole heart, and with only a jaunty 141 chapters, it breezes right by. It has one of my favorite MC's, commits wholeheartedly to its premise, and sticks the very difficult landing it set up for.</p>
    <p>To give a little more of what is actually going on in the story, it starts with our main man Yumeji, a student with friends and hobbies, joining together with Merry, a person not from around these parts, hellbent on send Dream Demons back to the Dream World. They monster-of-the-week their way into an overarching story with many twists and turns and ends with them essentially fighting god. It's awesome.</p>

    <h3>Make the Exorcist Fall in Love ✔</h3>
    <p>This manga caught my eye initially purely based off of it's unique artstyle. The lines are thicker, but the shapes and characters are softer. The series, however, is sparse in terms of softness, and while its characters do have moments of peace, the story is anything but peacefull.</p>
    <p><i>Make the Exorcist Fall in Love</i> follows the young Priest whose name is literally always just boy or Priest and his protection of Imuri, a demon girl sent by Satan whom he thinks is an innocent bystander caught up in a war of attrition between Satan and his Sins and the humans and their Priests. </p>
    <p>All of the characters are electrifying, especially Imuri, and the journey they go on together as the war between factions grows, new factions wax and wane, and the story twists into an altogether bigger tale than I expected when I initially started. Talk about a run-on sentence.</p>

    <img src="https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/manga/cover/large/bx101315-8qNFN4mJRYO2.jpg" alt="Yancha Gal no Anjou-san manga cover" style="float:right; height:350px; padding:5px">
    <h3>Yancha Gal no Anjou-san ☆</h3>
    <p>When I started reading manga initially, I basically only read romance for a bit, and a lot of them were just okay, or I dropped, or both. This manga, however, despite starting out similar to many that I dropped, only got better and better with time and I can confiidently say is one of the better ensemble-long-running-romance manga. </p>
    <p>Despite not being completed, the story feels like it could both go on for many more chapters without going stale or end in a dozen chapters with a heartfelt conclusion I'd be happy with. It strikes a perfect balance of progression and evolution while staying true to its original, slice-of-life charm.</p>
    <p>Do be warned, though, there's a bit of ecchi in there, nothing too crazy, but it's there. Even with this "downside," though, this series is great as it follows along the highs and lows of a cute high school romance. Just overall very sweet.</p>
