    <p>Yeah, I've got a podcast. Kinda my main thing I'm doing right now. It doesn't have a main subject besides me talking about things and I usually get sidetracked so that's always fun. New episodes come out every Friday at 3PM EST. Every 10th episode is a cooking episode (whatever that means). </p>

    <p>The podcast is on YouTube but like, there's other stuff that I do on YouTube too. Or there will be soon. I'm trying to get more out there I promise. More gaming, more video essays, more silly.</p>

    <p>I'm something of an opinion haver when it comes to anime and manga and so if you care about those at all, follow me on Anilist. I intend to start going through and uploading reviews to everything I've completed but who knows how long that'll take.</p>
