    <p>So this is the place you ended up, huh? You’re kinda weird for that because this is the place where I keep all the things that are too complicated to be constantly sent in the four discords I spend most of my time on. Honestly, if you’re here, you have probably had at least one conversation with me and I apologize for whatever I said. It was probably unhinged. Anyway, on to the good stuff.</p>

    <p>So if you haven’t met me, I guess I should introduce myself. I go by spjoti, simmy, spjortle, and spaghetti. Alright, maybe not really that last one. I spend too much time on a couple of Discord servers and have, quite simply, too many hobbies. I’m a jack of all trades, what can I say?</p>
    <p>I built this website myself through learning HTML. I like tech hardware like cameras and microphones and setting them up to make things. I love reading manga and having hard opinions about them. I like tinkering and understanding how things work and processes and setups so that I can use them myself to make things. I like writing scripts for videos I may never make. It’s a lot.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://spjoti.com/mangarec.html">Manga Recommendations</a></h3>
    <p>So over the years I have been at the forefront of making very bad images in MS Paint and definitely legally obtained Adobe Illustrator to highlight my favorite recommendations for manga (and anime). Unfortunately for me, I have finally just about hit the limit of what I can cram on a single image without completely sacrificing legibility and artistic-ness so I have come to the difficult decision to finally turn my rec image pinned in like 2 servers into a webpage because then I have no limits! I am a coward.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://anilist.co/user/Spjoti/">Anilist</a></h3>
    <p>Anilist is the place where I track all of my currently reading manga (nearly daily) and currently watching anime (monthly if you’re lucky). Keep tabs on it if you want to know the heat before I end up putting it on my recommendation pages.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@spjoti">Spjoti (YouTube)</a></h3>
    <p>The podcast is on YouTube but like, there's other stuff that I do on YouTube too. Or there will be soon. I'm trying to get more out there I promise. More gaming, more video essays, more silly. You can check out my current subscriber count <a href="https://spjoti.com/Spjoti.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://spjoti.com/simmyPODCAST.html">:simmyPODCAST:</a> (ON HOLD)</h3>
    <p>Yeah, I had a podcast. It didn't have a main subject besides me talking about things and I usually got sidetracked. At the very least the cooking episodes were bangers. </p>
