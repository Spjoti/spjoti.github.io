    <h1>:simmyWEBSITE: 2.0</h1>

    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>Hello! This is so quirky and silly that I have my own little website now. What will I ever do with all this freedom? Probably nothing exciting or good, but definitely vaguely entertaining!</p>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="https://blog.spjoti.com/">:simmyBLOG:</a></h3>
    <p>Clearly I've lost it because I've shouted into the void long enough I think people actually might want to follow a blog rather than watch me say the same thing in four discords. I also don't know how to code so this'll be fun.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@spjoti">Spjoti (YouTube)</a></h3>
    <p>The podcast is on YouTube but like, there's other stuff that I do on YouTube too. Or there will be soon. I'm trying to get more out there I promise. More gaming, more video essays, more silly. You can check out my current subscriber count <a href="https://spjoti.com/Spjoti.html">here</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="https://anilist.co/user/Spjoti/">Anilist</a></h3>
    <p>I'm something of an opinion haver when it comes to anime and manga and so if you care about those at all, follow me on Anilist. I intend to start going through and uploading reviews to everything I've completed but who knows how long that'll take.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><a href="https://spjoti.com/simmyPODCAST.html">:simmyPODCAST:</a> (ON HOLD)</h3>
    <p>Yeah, I had a podcast. It didn't have a main subject besides me talking about things and I usually got sidetracked. At the very least the cooking episodes were bangers. </p>
